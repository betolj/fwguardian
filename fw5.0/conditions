#   set-condition
#
#   With set-condition you can create conditions for the *script*. So far the
#   only test available is the "exist" to validate the presence of a file.
#
#   The *condition tests* applies only to the *processing of the script* and can 
#   be used in "fwinput", "fwroute" and "tfshape.conf". Do not set it directly on
#   this files. For this configuration choose the file "conditions".
#
#   Each rule, policy or QoS class can be tested with option "chk=".
#
#   - It is a useful resource in a cluster environment.
